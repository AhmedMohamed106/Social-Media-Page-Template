## Project Description
This project is a responsive social media page template built using Bootstrap. It incorporates a fixed, collapsible navbar, a dynamic layout that adjusts based on screen size, and an interactive post feature that allows users to create new posts with their name and personal photo. The design ensures a seamless user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes with the following configurations:
  - Large screens: Columns 3, 7, and 2 for left, middle, and right content respectively.
  - Medium screens: Columns 2, 8, and 2 for left, middle, and right content respectively.
  - Small screens: Full-width columns for all sections.
- **Fixed Collapsible Navbar:** A navbar that remains fixed at the top of the page and can be collapsed for smaller screens.
- **Profile Image Handling:** The profile image is hidden on small screens.
- **Column Visibility:** The right column is hidden on extra small screens.
- **Interactive Post Feature:** Users can create new posts with their name and personal photo.
